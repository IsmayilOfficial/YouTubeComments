# Methods and Tools for Automatic Sampling and Analysis of YouTube Comments

This repository contains materials for a research project for the automatic collection and analysis of YouTube comments.
Specifically, it contains an R script that walks the user through setting up an environment, creating a Google Account and authenticating the local session with the YouTube Application Programming Interface (API), and using the tuber R-package to extract comments. Furthermore, we provide a function for parsing comments into a formatted dataframe that makes subsequent analysis of comments easier, requiring minimal datawrangling. Furthermore, we provide an interactive Jupyter Notebook examplifying the analysis of text and used emojis which is executable in the browser.

The goal of this project is to publish a paper on methods and tools for the automatic collection and analysis of YouTube comments.
